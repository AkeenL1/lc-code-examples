## Common Strategies
## Two Pointers:
Use two indices to process elements from both ends or to maintain subarray boundaries. This is effective in sorted arrays or when removing duplicates.

### Sliding Window:
Dynamically adjust a window over the array to handle contiguous segment problems, such as finding the maximum subarray sum or a substring with specific constraints.

### Sorting:
Sort the array first to simplify duplicate handling, enable two-pointer techniques, or set up binary search.

### Prefix Sum:
Precompute cumulative sums to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray, which is particularly useful for range-sum queries.
